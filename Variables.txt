#1
Write a program called name.rb that asks the user to type in their name and then prints out a greeting message with their name included.

See separate file


#2
Write a program called age.rb that asks a user how old they are and then tells them how old they will be in 10, 20, 30 and 40 years. Below is the output for someone 20 years old.

See separate file


#3
Add another section onto name.rb that prints the name of the user 10 times. You must do this without explicitly writing the puts method 10 times in a row. Hint: you can use the times method to do something repeatedly.

See name.rb


#4
Modify name.rb again so that it first asks the user for their first name, saves it into a variable, and then does the same for the last name. Then outputs their full name all at once.

See name.rb


#5
Look at the following programs...

x = 0
3.times do
  x += 1
end
puts x

and...

y = 0
3.times do
  y+= 1
  x = y
end
puts x


What does x print to the screen in each case? Do they both give errors? Are the errors different? Why?
It prints 3 both times becuase in the second case x is just a reference point for y
instead of permanently assigning value.

THEIR SOLUTION
The first prints 3 to the screen. The second throws an error undefined local variable or method because x is not available as it is created within the scope of the do/end block.


#6
What does the following error message tell you?

NameError: undefined local variable or method `shoes' for main:Object
  from (irb):3
  from /usr/local/rvm/rubies/ruby-2.0.0-rc2/bin/irb:16:in `<main>'

That shoes was used on line 3 of irb without being defined, or being formatted as
a string. 

THEIR SOLUTION:
The program is trying to reference a variable or method named shoes that has not been defined in the program, or is outside of the scope in which it is being called.
