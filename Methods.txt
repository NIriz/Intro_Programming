#1
Write a program that contains a method called greeting that takes a name as its parameter. It then prints a greeting message with the name included in it.

See greeting.rb


#2
1. x = 2
  2

2. puts x = 2
  2

3. p name = "Joe"
  'Joe'

4. four = "four"
  'four'

5. print something = "nothing"
  'nothing'

CORRECT SOLUTION: 
2
nil 
'Joe'
'four'
nil


#3
Write a program that includes a method called multiply that takes two arguments and returns the product of the two numbers.

See multiply.rb


#4
What will the following code print to the screen?

def scream(words)
  words = words + "!!!!"
  return
  puts words
end

scream("Yippeee")

It won't print anything because the return will make the method quit before
getting to the 'puts' statement.  


#5
1) Edit the method in exercise #4 so that it does print words on the screen.
2) What does it return now? Nil

1)
def scream(words)
  words = words + "!!!!"
  puts words
end

scream("Yippeee")


#6
What does the following error message tell you?

ArgumentError: wrong number of arguments (1 for 2)
  from (irb):1:in `calculate_product'
  from (irb):4
  from /Users/username/.rvm/rubies/ruby-2.0.0-p353/bin/irb:12:in `<main>'

That you provided only one argument to a method that needs 2.
