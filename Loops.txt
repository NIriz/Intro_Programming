#1
What does the each method in the following program return after it is finished executing?

x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
x.each do |a|
  a + 1
end

Should return [2,3,4,5,6] WRONG! 
It actually returns [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], remember that we're not storing the 'new' +1 values anywhere.


#2
Write a while loop that takes input from the user, performs an action, and only stops when the user types "STOP". Each loop can get info from the user.

puts "Say whatever you want, when you get tired of talking, say: STOP"

a = " "
while a != 'STOP'
  a = gets.chomp
end


#3
Use the each_with_index method to iterate through an array of your creation that prints each index and value of the array.

x = ['dog', 'cat', 'pig', 'eel']

x.each_with_index do |name, index|
  puts "#{index}. #{name}"
end   


#4
Write a method that counts down to zero using recursion.

def countdown(start)
  if start <= 0
    puts number
  else
    puts number  
    countdown(start - 1)
  end
end    

puts countdown(10)
